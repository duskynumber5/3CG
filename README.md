Killian Peters
Comments: Cards look like they're "glowing" even when they are not grabbable. 
Adjustments: I added a black overlay to cards in the player's hand that are not grabbable. 

Joseph Cortez
Comments: The board was really spread out and there was a lot of dead space.
Adjustments: I made the screen size smaller for now to decrease the dead space. 


### POSTMORTEM

A postmortem on what you did well and what you would do differently if you were to do this project over again
